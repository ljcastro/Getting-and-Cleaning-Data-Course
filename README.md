Getting and Cleaning Data Course
================================

Code examples and PA of the Johns Hopkins Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The script **run_analysis.R** contains the reproducible code in R for the Peer Assessment *Getting and Cleaning Data Project*.

You must download the Data set to your working directory in order to reproduce the code. Please download from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Once downloaded, unzip the file, and you must see a new directory called *UCI HAR Dataset*.

This directory contains all the files needed to run the code.

In order to obtain the results, you must run the code in the order established in the script.

Happy coding!
